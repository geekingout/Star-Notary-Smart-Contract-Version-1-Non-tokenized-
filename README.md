# Star-Notary-Smart-Contract-Version-1-Non-tokenized
Used truffleboxes as boiler plate for this app.
Ported contract to Truffle and wrote several test cases. 
Then designed the frontend for the Dapp connected to a private Ethereum network runing on port 9545 that can call functions on the contract.
